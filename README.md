# The most dangerous cities for cyclists or the use of probability in a news story

As part of my final project of the MA in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University, I have been examining statistical methods for journalistic stories.

On this occasion, I have explored the use of probability for a story about the most dangerous cities for cyclists in the West Midlands. 

As with my previous analysis, I have used R to find the model and analyse the data. I also have done the charts using ggplot library.
